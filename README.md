This is a script that uses the yfinance library to download stock data for a given ticker symbol, uses the historical data to train a HistGradientBoostingRegressor model, and generates predictions for the next 30 days. The script also adds random values with a standard deviation of 20% of the last year's close prices standard deviation to the predicted prices to simulate the uncertainty in stock prices. Finally, it plots the actual prices and the predicted prices using matplotlib, with the last date's close price in green if it's greater or equal to the last date's close price of the last year, otherwise red. It also formats the x-axis as a date format and rotates the labels. The script shows the plot in the end.
